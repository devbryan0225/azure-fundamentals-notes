# QnA Notes

## Administration
- Pay as you go model allows you to shift from CAPEX to OPEX.

## Platform as a Service (IAAS)
- Azure VM, Azure Storage

## Platform as a Service (PAAS)
- Host your own web apps.
- No control over the OS.
- Have the ability the scale the platform.
- Provides professional development services.
- Azure App Service, SQL databases

## Software as a Service (SAAS)
- User responsible for configuring SAAS solution only.
- Service provider manage hardware, software, availability, and security.

## Azure VM
- Continue to pay storage costs when VM stopped.
- Although two VMs having the same size, disk config may be different, hence different monthly costs.

## Fault Tolerance
- Availability zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region.
- Datacenters with this physical separation protects apps and data from datacenter failures.

## Public Cloud
- Shared entity with multicorporations using a portion of the resources.
- No longer requires datacenter.
- Metered pricing and self-service management.
- Anyone with Azure AD can access cloud resources.
- Extend internal network with public cloud through VPN.

## Hybrid Cloud
- Continue using on-premise servers, add new servers in Azure.
- Minimizing both CAPEX and OPEX.
- Can start out both ways from either public cloud or on-premise.

## Elasticity
- Autoscaling resources.
